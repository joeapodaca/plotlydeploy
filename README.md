## Overview

Improbable Beef is looking for volunteers to analyze the types of bacteria that colonize their bellies. Some of them will be suitable for synthetic beef production, while others will not. These are visualizations for the demographic information about the bacterial data for each volunteerâ€™s belly button. Each subject was given an ID number. Their ethnicity, gender, age, location, belly button type and wash frequency were all logged. The top 10 bacterial species have been identified in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
